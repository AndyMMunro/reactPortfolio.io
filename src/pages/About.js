                Skydiving resulted in me traveling all over the USA and adventuring in many other different sports and
                avenues which
                otherwise would not have been within my reach. Although exciting and interesting skydiving is not an
                occupation that
                pays well or is gentile on the body. So I decided to change gears to something more sustainable both for
                my body and my
                wallet. That avenue was aviation.

                I went back to school and became a pilot in both helicopters and airplanes. It was a very rewarding
                avenue of work and
                will always be something that I enjoy. But with aviation comes a lot of travel and also A LOT of time
                away from home
                which becomes tedious and makes it hard to maintain relationships. With the blossoming of Covid I was
                granted an
                opportunity to move to the venue of web/software development. Which has proved to be just as rewarding.

                This massive change in lifestyle has been extremely welcomed. Tech has been something that I have been
                interested in and
                pursued in my leisure time for a very long time due to the nature of the work which essentially is
                building cool stuff
                which I am a huge fan of. This field is challenging and fast moving making it an excellent fit for me.
                On this page you will see some of my projects feel free to inquire about any of them.
